# ParallelAS3
Compile instructions: at the command line type "javac BirthdayParty.java" on one line, then type "java BirthdayParty on the next. Do the same with "Temperature.java". The program will run and print the output to the console for you. You can also just download and hit "run" if using an IDE.

#1: This solution demonstrates efficiency through the utilization of  ConcurrentHashMap and ConcurrentLinkedQueue, ensuring thread-safe operations without explicit locking. While we efficiently allocate memory for gift bags and cards, the complexity of the ConcurrentLinkedList implementation may introduce performance overhead. Despite this, the solution maintains correctness by enforcing synchronized access to critical sections, preventing data integrity issues. Progress is guaranteed through a straightforward locking mechanism.

#2: This solution demonstrates efficient use of system resources by using multi-threading to parallelize data collection across multiple cores, speeding up the process compared to sequential readings. It ensures controlled access to shared data through synchronized methods, which while preventing data inconsistency, may introduce performance overhead with increased thread count or resource contention. Additionally, by pre-allocating memory for sensor readings, it avoids dynamic allocation overhead, though this might result in high memory usage for extended missions. We maintain high correctness, maintaining data integrity through synchronized blocks that prevent concurrent data modifications,  ensuring accurate sensor readings. We ensure progress by averting deadlocks through straightforward synchronized block usage without nested locks, reducing the likelihood of concurrency issues.
